# SRE Workshop

A hands-on workshop series covering essential SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) skills — containerization with Docker and CI/CD automation with GitHub Actions.

## Workshops

|----------|----------|-------------|
| [Docker](docker/) | 2 hours | Docker fundamentals, Dockerfile, and Docker Compose |
| [CI/CD](cicd/) | 2 hours | GitHub Actions, CI pipeline, release and deployment automation |

> **Recommended order:** Docker first, then CI/CD — the CI/CD workshop assumes Docker knowledge.
