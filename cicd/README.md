## Sample Application

`examples/sample-app` is a simple **Go HTTP API server** with basic RESTful endpoints. It serves as the foundation for all demos and exercises throughout the workshop — you'll build a complete CI/CD pipeline for it, covering automated testing, code quality checks, Docker image builds, and deployment.
